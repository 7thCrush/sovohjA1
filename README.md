# Assignment 1:

## How to operate the assignment via make-commands:

- `make` creates the object files needed to run the assignment
- `make test` tests the assignment via testbench
- `make clean` cleans the object files

## Notes:

If you want to repeat a particular random input, you can specify the seed of that run with command line argument "-s <num>".
If you give "-l" argument, very long test is also run with 1MB input size.
